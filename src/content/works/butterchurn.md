## Huh?

This installation seeks to immitate a fairground attraction „Test Your Strength“ game to comment on the gamification and commodification of tradtional artisanship. It was commissioned by the Ars Electronica.

The user tries to turn the lever on the butterchurn as fast as possible while tracking their progress on the sequentially activated lamps on a score display. Once they have completed and won the game, they are presented with an industrially made, prepackaged piece of butter as a reward.
