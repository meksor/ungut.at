## Huh?


My cousin found an old and broken electronic organ on the internet for free! A few days later it was standing in my bedroom.

Lukas Hannen (qbe), Nico Rameder and me decided to take it apart and look at the internals. What we found was a harrowing mess of cables and electronics from the 80s.
Soon enough we had figured out how the keyboard logic worked (thanks to a service manual) and replaced the internal electronics with our own amplifiers and mircocontrollers.
It is now able to control external MIDI devices and also usable as a soundsystem.

It made it's first public appearance at Schmiede 2020 where Julian Kenji and I performed on it together. It was very loud.
