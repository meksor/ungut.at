What once was a broken kid's piano now is a horrifying instrument which synthesizes sounds reminiscent of horrifing scenarios including (but not limited to):

- running out of milk on a sunday
- not being able to sleep because you ate too much
- a distupgrade breaking your system

Its use as a musical instrument requires alot of experience and skill.

## Features

The Aharmonicum has a photo-resistor in the back which changes the pitch of the whole instrument, which also means it needs to be constantly retuned. The screws on the side enable to use your body as a noise source. Depending on the pressure applied the Aharmonicum becomes more or less nightmarish. It even has a tape-based shoulder strap for riveting stage performances. (Performer: Mazzo)
