## Huh?

Daniel's (frontend), Robert's (design & illustration) and my (backend) diploma project at Graphische. A website in 3 designs (chosen randomly), fed by a nonesense text generator which remixed american news articles from the last week. It uses Wikidata to get pictures for salient entities in the article.
