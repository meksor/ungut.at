## Ever wanted to control a clicktrack device with midi?

So did qbe and me.

This gadget turns midi clock messages into clicktrack pulses with a clock divider in between which enables triplets and more.
Technically, you could play this thing like a mini-rythm controlling keyboard by putting this between your sequencer and midi clock.
