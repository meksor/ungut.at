## Huh?

Omare.net was an online newspaper analysis and meta search engine.
It scraped articles from 13 of the biggest austrian online newspapers and made them searchable.
Let me tell you one thing: you never notice how often people change their website before you start writing crawlers.
This was my first software service with all the bells and whistles. It brought my single self-hosted postgres instance to its knees and required some creative solutions to offset my under-qualification. 

omare.net featured a crawler framework, a natural-language analysis pipeline, complicated ontology, full-text search optimizations and a comprhensive UI to look at it all.
